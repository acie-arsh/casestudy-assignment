# Features Implemented

Profile List : a webpage that presents a collection of profiles, each comprising essential information such as the person's name photograph, and a brief description.

Summary: Each Profile has coordinates linked to it and clicking on "Summary" button will show you the location on a map. Implemented using Mapbox GL JS library and other Mapbox APIs

Add Profiles: You can add profiles to the list, keep in mind that a simple refresh will bring the list to it's original state as there is no backend solution implemented

Delete Profiles: You can delete any of the profiles in the list, again, a refresh will reset all the data to initial state!

Bonus: ALL of the added profiles WILL HAVE A VALID SUMMARY MAP ATTACHED TO THEM! (Given that proper latitude and longitude is provided during profile addition)
